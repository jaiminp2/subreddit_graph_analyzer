## Team Contract (ablamp2-varunrs2-vad4-jaiminp2)

### Communication
1. **Team Meetings**  Our team will meet once a week every Monday from 5-7 PM using Discord. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with Varun. Notes will be stored on a Discord server, having time stamps for each meeting.
2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email ({ablamp, varunrs2, vad4, jaiminp2}@illinois.edu) or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.
3. **Respect** We will commit to making sure everyone's thoughts are heard through asking for everyone's individual input when a design decision is being made. When a conflict arises, we will use a majority-rules vote.

### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned the task.
2. **Time Commitment** Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication.
3. **Conflict Resolution** For conflict resolution and ties with deciding on design decisions, we will have a match on TypeRacer to come to a resolution.
